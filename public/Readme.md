# Awesome Virtual HeadSet WebSite with React JS

This is responsive react App for HeadSet, my first one!

## Description

I realize through this project a template based on react JS. This is a multipage site using animation libraries like framer-motion, vanilla. The content is completely responsive and therefore adapts correctly to the different device formats (computer, tablet, smartphone).

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

To run this project you must have react installed on your computer.
You must therefore consult the official react documentation to install it if this is not already the case. But you can have a direct demo of the application by following the link below:

For those who have React installed on their machines, you can download the code above and run it with the "npm start" command;

But before that I already advise you to consult the JSON to know the versions of the modules used.

In this project I used the following versions:

"react": "^18.2.0";

"react-icons": "^4.4.0";

"react-router-dom": "^6.4.2";

"react-scripts": "5.0.1";

"vanilla-tilt": "^1.7.2";

"framer-motion": "^7.6.1";
